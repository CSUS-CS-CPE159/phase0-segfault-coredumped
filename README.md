Feedback format
Clear and detailed feedback will help students recognize their strengths and pinpoint areas for
improvement in the next phase. The feedback should highlight both the strengths and weaknesses
of the submission. Use bullet points to organize each item. When adding feedback to the Git
repository README file, ensure that previous feedback is retained. Append new feedback below
the existing ones with a timestamp to track progress.
